This is the Code, to upload the Tamper Evident Bag Numbers from the Specter Hardware Wallets to my website.

This are the files I use for the website:
https://proof.clavastack.com/

Hosted at https://hpanel.hostinger.com/websites/

The files index.js and package.js are hosted in my google cloud run.
https://console.cloud.google.com/

Here I have two environment variables:
GEMINI_API_KEY = xxxxxxxxxxxx
AUTH_TOKEN = [like a password]

Also the website already works if you paste the index.html code into Gemini and say that it should make it work. Then it should work in Canvas of Gemini where it even adds a API token which automatically works as long as you are in Gemini Canvas.
